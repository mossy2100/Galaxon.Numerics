Fractions
=========
* Add support for mixed numbers to the Fraction class e.g. 2 3/4. Format can be "M".
So:
  "U" would be unicode, proper or improper. n/d
  "M" would be same as "U" if n < d, or mixed format if n > d
  "A" format does not support mixed

* Update comparison operators to compare numerators if the denominators are equal.

* Write more tests.


Integers
========
Remove any methods that aren't needed.
Move any I want to keep to Core.
